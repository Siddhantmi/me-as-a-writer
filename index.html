      <h1>I can never follow the time table.</h1>
      <h4>Date:28th june 2021 Time:10:35pm</h4> <br> <br>
      <p>"After giving time of 4 to 5 hours , I made a time table which was to be followed from the next day.Plan was very good it was having everything that I want to do.After making such a good plan I was very happy, for me and was assuming that from tomorrow my life will change.Thinking about it I went for sleep. <br>Next day I woke up at 7:00 am , but plan was to wake up at 5:30 am. I was little bit disappointed but was having a hope to recover the time by working extra in free time. <br> Then next was the plan to do web development , but I did something else which is not related to web development. <br> Next was to take bath at 8:30 am this task I did <strong>completed</strong>. Then plan was to do some studies related to college subject , since exams are coming closer. For that I made list of chapters ,it took hardly 5 minutes then I thought to download pdf of maths from google class room. I connect my laptop to internet and what I find that My internet is draining very fast and I only had 2 Gb data so I was worried, but after 15 minutes I figured out the problem and solved it. then as i thought I opned google classroom and started downloading pdf , but firefox donwloaded it directly without asking for which location file should be saved and what should be the name of the file this made my mood off . Then I spent 50 to 60 minutes searching out how to solve this problem, I got the solution but now I was very angery at firefox . So I decided to switch to chrome.Then i opend it and made some setup and started to make some modifications inside chrome like changing themes , fonts, background images , language preferncesetc. <br> After realising that I am wasting time , I decide to get back to time table . But a stange thing happened , Watch was showing 1:15 pm I was shocked and was regreating for wastage of time. Then mummy called me to have lunch and then I went to have lunch. <br> While having lunch I found that "fast five " movie is be being telecast on "sony pix". Then I decided to have some rest and watch the movie. I watched full movie and but after watching the movie I was feeling sleepy so I went to sleep.
      I wake up at 4:00 pm. Again I was disappointed but then I made chai and started to watch web development videos. And then I found a course From edureka "complete web development in 10 hr" then i explored that full by taking the glipsim of the course. It was good course, and I decided to start this course form next day. <br>Then My father's call came and he asked me to make excle sheetfor him. Then I stared that work.I completed it just before writing this content i.e., at 10:30 pm , then I stared writing this story. <br> <br> So over all I was able to follow only one task according to my time table. Now I have to options Either to drop this idea of plan and time table and live life without any time table and other it just oposite of it. <br> <br> What should I chose? <br>I will follow the time table , so that I can perform more than 1 task tomorrow and head towards betterment." <br> <br> <br> <br> Thanks for reading.
